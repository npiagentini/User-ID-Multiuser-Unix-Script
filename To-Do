List of enhancements
1)	Dynamic port allocation – we need a way to assign ports to users without hard coding them to specific user names.
2)	Masking of the API key – We need to either wrap the curl request or reference the key from a file so it is not visible in ps when it is running.
3)	Log off script- We need a clean up script. Probably need to determine what information we need to store locally from the startup process to properly clean up as well.
4)	Need to wrap the iptables command so that the user does not have to be root.
